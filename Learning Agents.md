# Learning Agents

Rather than working on previously known knowledge only, providing a learning mechanism to the Intelligence Agent (IA) can provide better results in unseen situations. This is the core motive behind developing Learning Agents.

A Learning Agent has 4 major components - 

1) Learning Element - helps in making improvements based on past performances.
2) Performance Element - the part that actually selects external actions for the current task according to the percepts.
3) Critic - it provides feedback on current performance of the agent to the learning element.
4) Problem Generator - suggests exploratory actions to the agents for the areas of behaviour in need of improvement.

Designing of learning element highly depends design of the performance element. Given the agent design, learning mechanisms can be construced to improve every part of the agent. Hence, developing the performance element is the first step.

Also, the performance standard should remain fixed for the critic to work on.

Learning in intelligent agents can be summarized as a process of modification of each component of the agent to bring the components into closer agreement with the available feedback information, thereby improv- ing the overall performance of the agent.
